            <p><h3>Problem #7: WE ARE WIRED!!!</h3>
<u><b>Background Information:</b></u>   A connection strip is made up of a series of posts; half of them are white, the other half black.  Each of the black posts must be connected by a wire to one white post and each white post must be connected to one black post.  For simplicity, we will consider the length of wire used for a single connection to be the number of posts the white is from the black.  For example, here is a possible connection strip (with the posts numbered):</p>

<b>Programming Problem:</u></b>

    Input: 	    From a file named input7, a sequence of non-negative integers, one value per line. Each non-zero integer will represent a run of the same colored posts. The sequence of integers will end with a 0. You should assume that the first post is white. The input below corresponds to the graphic above. 


    Output:    To a file output7, the length of wire needed to connect the posts and a list of the connections, one connection per line.
