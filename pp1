        <h4>Problem #1: Be There, And Be More than Square</h4>
        <p><u>Background Information:</u> On a standard 8x8 checkerboard you can identify 1,296 unique rectangles. On a </p>
        <p>1x1 checkerboard there is just one rectangle. On a 2x2 checkerboard there are 9 unique rectangles. On a </p>
        <p>3x3 checkerboard there are 36 unique rectangles. On a 4x4 checkerboard there are 100 unique rectangles. </p>
        <p>On a 5x5 checkerboard there are 225 unique rectangles. On a 6x6 checkerboard there are 441 unique </p>
        <p>rectangles. In fact, on an NxN checkerboard there are rectangles. </p>

        <p><u>Programming Problem:</u></p>
        <p>Input:  a positive integer N less than 200, for the size of a checkerboard.</p>
        <p>Output: the number of rectangles on the NxN checkerboard.</p>

Example 1:	 Input: 	6
                Output: 	441

Example 2: 	 Input: 	10
                Output: 	3025
