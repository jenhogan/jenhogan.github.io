        <h4>Problem #2: SIMPLIFIED POKER</h4>
        <p><u>Background Information:</u> Most poker hands use five cards. In simplified four card poker, four cards
        are used for a hand. Four card poker hands are classified as one of the following: a Royal Flush, Sraight
        Flush, Four-of-a-Kind, Flush, Straight, Three-of-a-kind, Two-pairs, One-Pair, Nothing.  You will be given 
        four cards from a regulation 52-card deck of playing cards. Your program will determine if the four cards constitute:</p>
        
        <pre>
<b>Four-of-a-Kind</b>  (all four cards of the same kind),
<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b> (three cards of the same kind and one card different),
<b>Two-Pairs</b>       (two cards of the same kind and the other two cards of the same kind 
                but different than the first pair),
<b>One-Pair</b>        (two cards of the same kind and the other two cards of different kinds),
Or
<b>No-Matches.</b>     (all four cards of different kinds),
Note that in simplified poker we are not computing any other type of hand such as flushes or straights. 
             
        </pre>


<p>Normally, each card would be designated with a kind and a suit. For this problem, we will be ignoring the suits and just designating the kind of each card. The kind will be in the range  [2, 14], with  2 for a Two, 3 for a Three, â€¦ 11 for a Jack, 12 for a Queen, 13 for a King, and 14 for an Ace.
    Cards will be input from lowest to highest. </p>
        

        
        


        
        <p><u>Programming Problem:</u></p>

        <pre>  <!-- note, how it appears within these tags is how it will be on the screen-->
Input:		Four integers (in the range 2..14) in ascending order.
                The four integers will be on four separate lines. 
Output:	        The type of hand followed by the four cards (integers).

Example 1:	Input:	7 7 7 7
                Output:	<b>Four-of-a-Kind</b>   7 7 7 7
	
Example 2:	Input:	3 9 9 9
                Output:	<b>Three-of-a-Kind</b>   3 9 9 9

Example 3:	Input:	2 4 4 6
                Output:	<b>One-Pair</b>    2 4 4 6

Example 4:	Input:	10 11 12 13
                Output:	<b>No-Matches</b>      10 11 12 13
