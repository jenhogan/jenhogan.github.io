<!--Past problems page that links to several pages that show past problems. Note that there is partial data available going back to 2000. Note that each year 6-7 problems were given, so there is a lot of content to share. You can design a page for each year that is available or a page for each problem. But the pages should be linked in a logical way. -->

        <h4>Problem #7: WE ARE WIRED!!!</h4>
        <p><u>Background Information:</u>   A connection strip is made up of a series of posts; half of them are white, the other half black.  Each of the black posts must be connected by a wire to one white post and each white post must be connected to one black post.  For simplicity, we will consider the length of wire used for a single connection to be the number of posts the white is from the black.  For example, here is a possible connection strip (with the posts numbered):</p>

        <p><u>Programming Problem:</u></p>
    <pre>
INPUT- 	    From a file named input7, a sequence of non-negative integers, one value 
            per line. Each non-zero integer will represent a run of the same colored
            posts. The sequence of integers will end with a 0. You should assume that
            the first post is white. The input below corresponds to the graphic above. 
OUTPUT-	    To a file output7, the length of wire needed to connect the posts and 
            a list of the connections, one connection per line.
