        <p><h4>Problem #3: PYTHAGOREAN DAYS</h4></p>
    
        <p><u><b>Background Information:</b></u> A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c such that a2 + b2 = c2. A right triangle whose sides form a Pythagorean triple is called a Pythagorean triangle. Another way to describe a Pythagorean triangle is a triangle with a 90 degree angle with all sides being integers. May 12, 2013 was a Pythagorean Day because we write the date as 5-12-13 and (5, 12, 13) is a Pythagorean triple. Note that we designate the year using only the last two digits. Also note that the year for a Pythagorean day is always the hypotenuse of the corresponding right triangle. </p>

<u><b>Programming Problem:</u></b>
Input: M and N (one input value per line), two years in the 21st century. Note: The year 2000 is not in the 21st century and the year 2100 is.
           
Output: The number of Pythagorean days in the given range (inclusive) followed by the dates in chronological order.
