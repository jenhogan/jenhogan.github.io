<!--Past problems page that links to several pages that show past problems. Note that there is partial data available going back to 2000. Note that each year 6-7 problems were given, so there is a lot of content to share. You can design a page for each year that is available or a page for each problem. But the pages should be linked in a logical way. -->

        <h4>Problem #3: PYTHAGOREAN DAYS</h4>
        <p><u>Background Information:</u></p>
        <p>A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c such that a2 + b2 = c2. A right triangle whose sides form a Pythagorean triple is called a Pythagorean triangle. Another way to describe a Pythagorean triangle is a triangle with a 90 degree angle with all sides being integers. May 12, 2013 was a Pythagorean Day because we write the date as 5-12-13 and (5, 12, 13) is a Pythagorean triple. Note that we designate the year using only the last two digits. Also note that the year for a Pythagorean day is always the hypotenuse of the corresponding right triangle. </p>

<pre><u>Programming Problem:</u>
Input:  M and N (one input value per line), two years in the 21st century. Note: The year 2000 is
        not in the 21st century and the year 2100 is.
Output: The number of Pythagorean days in the given range (inclusive) followed by the 
        dates in chronological order. 



Example 1:	 Input: 		2002
					2014
Output: 	                        6
					3-4-5
					4-3-5
					6-8-10
					8-6-10
					5-12-13
					12-5-13
